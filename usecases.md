#  Introduction

Textbook Marketplace

Access to prescribed textbooks is crucial for academic success, yet many students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, struggle to afford them. While funding schemes like NSFAS and other bursaries provide book allowances, students often prioritize purchasing essential items such as laptops, leaving them with little or no money for textbooks. Although electronic versions of textbooks are sometimes available, they come with distractions that can hinder effective studying. Research suggests that students who use hardcopy textbooks tend to perform better academically. This raises concerns about how financial constraints and spending choices impact students' ability to access the learning materials necessary for their success.  

# Problem Statement 

Buying a textbook can be a hassle for students, especially students coming from poor backgrounds. Though NSFAS and other bursaries do provide students with book allowances only a few will go buy books with that money.For example say im doing my first year in BSc Computer Science and Informatics when i get my allowances i would buy a personal laptop and would be left with little or no money to buy the actual textbooks prescribed in all my modules.Though electronic versions are sometimes provided, true be told having a hardcopy textbook has less distructions and students that use textbooks tend to do well academically.
